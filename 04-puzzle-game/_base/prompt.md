# Use Case 04 – Novel Puzzle Game (GameForge)

## 1. Goal
Design and implement a polished, production-ready puzzle game as a web application. The game should feature an original, addicting mechanic—easy to learn but hard to master—with infinite replayability through procedural generation.

## 2. Context & Constraints
- **Stack**: Web-based (choose your framework)
- **Platform**: Desktop and mobile browsers
- **Out of scope**: Sound/music (game must be fully playable without audio)
- **Time estimate**: Medium complexity

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Core (Must Have)
- **Novel game mechanic** - Original concept, not a clone of existing puzzle games
- **Easy to learn, hard to master** - Simple rules that create deep strategic gameplay
- **Procedural generation** - Algorithmic level generation, no handcrafted levels
- **Fair losing condition** - Well-designed mechanism that leads to game over
- **Responsive design** - Works across different screen sizes
- **Browser compatibility** - Runs in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### 3.2 Stretch (Nice to Have)
- Score tracking and high scores
- Difficulty progression
- Accessibility features
- Mobile touch optimization

## 4. Quality Expectations
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between game logic, rendering, and input handling
- **Testing**: Comprehensive automated tests for game logic; browser testing with Playwright MCP
- **UX/UI**: Polished with smooth animations, responsive controls, professional presentation
- **Documentation**: Game rules, setup instructions, procedural generation explanation

## 5. Process
- Research game design best practices and procedural generation techniques
- Design a truly novel mechanic (not derivative of existing games)
- Implement core gameplay first, polish second
- Test across multiple browsers and devices

## 6. Deliverables
- [ ] Fully functional web-based puzzle game
- [ ] Procedural level generation working
- [ ] Test suite with good coverage
- [ ] README with game rules and setup
- [ ] Brief explanation of procedural generation approach

## 7. Success Criteria
- Game mechanic is genuinely original and engaging
- Game is simple to learn
- Procedurally generated levels feel varied and fair
- Game is polished and production-ready
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Works smoothly across platforms
