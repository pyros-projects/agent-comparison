# Use Case XX – [Name] ([Codename])

## 1. Goal
[3-5 line pitch - what are we building and why? What's the core value or interesting challenge?]

## 2. Context & Constraints
- **Stack/Language**: [e.g., Python 3.11+, Node.js 20+, or "your choice - justify in README"]
- **Hardware/Resources**: [if relevant, e.g., "24GB VRAM", "local only", "must run on laptop"]
- **Time estimate**: [rough complexity - "2-4 hours", "full day", "weekend project"]
- **Out of scope**: [what NOT to build - keep this focused]

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Core (Must Have)
- [Essential feature 1]
- [Essential feature 2]
- [Essential feature 3]
- ...

### 3.2 Stretch (Nice to Have)
- [Optional enhancement 1]
- [Optional enhancement 2]
- ...

## 4. Quality Expectations
- **Architecture**: [e.g., "clean separation of concerns", "modular design", "extensible"]
- **Testing**: [e.g., "comprehensive tests for core logic", "TDD encouraged", "test key scenarios"]
- **Code Quality**: [e.g., "type hints", "docstrings", "error handling"]
- **UX/UI**: [e.g., "polished and professional", "minimal but functional", "responsive"]
- **Documentation**: [what docs are expected - README, API docs, design docs, etc.]

## 5. Process
[Optional section - include only if there are specific process requirements like research phases or design documentation]

- Research phase: [if web research or investigation is expected]
- Design decisions: [if architecture/design doc required before implementation]
- Implementation approach: [if specific methodology like TDD is required]

## 6. Deliverables
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 1, e.g., "Working web application"]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 2, e.g., "Test suite with good coverage"]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 3, e.g., "DESIGN.md explaining architecture"]
- [ ] README with setup instructions and usage guide
- [ ] Source code with clear structure

## 7. Success Criteria
[3-5 concrete, measurable ways to know if this succeeded. These should align with the evaluation rubric.]

- [Criterion 1, e.g., "Core features all work correctly"]
- [Criterion 2, e.g., "Code is clean, maintainable, and well-tested"]
- [Criterion 3, e.g., "Documentation makes it easy for others to understand and run"]
- [Criterion 4, e.g., "Demonstrates creative problem-solving or novel approach"]
- [Criterion 5, e.g., "Production-ready quality in core areas"]

## Notes for Template Usage

- **Keep it concise** - Don't over-specify implementation details
- **Be clear about priorities** - Core vs Stretch should be obvious
- **Adjust sections as needed** - Not every use case needs Process section
- **Focus on outcomes** - What should exist, not how to build it
- **Leave room for creativity** - Especially for open-ended challenges
