# Use Case 10 – Novel AI Library (LibraryForge)

## 1. Goal
Research the AI/LLM Python library landscape, identify gaps and opportunities, conceptualize a genuinely novel library, and implement a working MVP. Tests research capability, creative ideation, and rapid prototyping.

## 2. Context & Constraints
- **Stack/Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Focus**: Creative/fun/weird use cases (not enterprise tooling)
- **Out of scope**: Production deployment, extensive features beyond MVP
- **Time estimate**: Full day to weekend project

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Phase 1: Research & Ideation (Must Have)
- **Landscape analysis**: Web search for AI/LLM libraries (mainstream and emerging)
- **Gap analysis**: Identify what's missing, painful, or underserved
- **Generate 5-7 novel ideas**: Focus on creative/fun applications
- **Rate and select**: Score ideas on novelty, delight, feasibility, etc.
- **Document in RESEARCH.md**: Libraries surveyed, gaps, ideas, ratings, selection justification

### 3.2 Phase 2: Implementation (Must Have)
- **Working library**: Core functionality fully implemented (no stubs/TODOs)
- **Pythonic API**: Clean, intuitive, with type hints and docstrings
- **Examples**: 2-3 scripts demonstrating the "wow factor"
- **Tests**: 5-10+ meaningful tests that pass
- **Packaging**: Installable with `pip install -e .`
- **Documentation**: Compelling README with quick start and API reference

### 3.3 Stretch (Nice to Have)
- More comprehensive feature set
- Advanced examples
- Performance optimization
- Contributing guidelines

## 4. Quality Expectations
- **Research**: Deep, web-based investigation revealing real gaps
- **Creativity**: Ideas are genuinely novel and exciting
- **Implementation**: MVP is polished and production-quality in core areas
- **API Design**: Elegant, delightful developer experience
- **Documentation**: Makes developers want to try it immediately

## 5. Process
- Conduct web research (use search tools)
- Document findings thoroughly in RESEARCH.md
- Rate ideas rigorously and select best one
- Implement MVP with focus on core concept
- Polish examples to show value

## 6. Deliverables
- [ ] RESEARCH.md with landscape analysis, gaps, 5-7 ideas, ratings, selection
- [ ] Working Python library (properly packaged)
- [ ] 2-3 example scripts showing creative use cases
- [ ] Test suite (5-10+ tests)
- [ ] Compelling README

## 7. Success Criteria
- Research reveals non-obvious gaps in ecosystem
- Selected idea scores highly on novelty and delight
- MVP actually works (no placeholders)
- API design is elegant and makes developers smile
- Examples demonstrate clear value and creativity
- Makes you think "I can't believe nobody thought of this!"
