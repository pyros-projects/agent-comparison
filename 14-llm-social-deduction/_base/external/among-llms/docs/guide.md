### Launching the Application
<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/main_screen.png" alt="main_screen">
</p>

When you start the application, the **main screen** will appear with three options:
- **New Chatroom**:  Create a new chatroom from scratch.
- **Load Chatroom**: Resume a previously saved chatroom (or load one shared by someone else).
- **Quit**:          Exit the application.

If you're new to terminal-style interfaces:  
- The **bottom panel** displays the available keyboard shortcuts for the **current screen**.  
- For example, **^a** represents **Ctrl+A**. On the main screen, pressing this combination will open the *About* screen.  

> [!TIP]  
> To close any screen or pop-up, press **^w** (i.e., **Ctrl+W**).  
> For more details on custom keyboard bindings, see [`bindings.md`](bindings.md). 


### Creating a New Chatroom
<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/customize_scenario.png" alt="new_chatroom_screen">
</p>

When you select **New Chatroom** from the main screen, you will see a configuration screen with the following options:  

- **Choose Genre**:  A drop-down menu offering a variety of genres. The default selection is *Sci-Fi*.  
- **Scenario**:      Defines the main setting of the chatroom.  
- **No. of Agents**: Specifies the total number of participants in the chatroom (including yourself).  

You can:  
- Generate random scenarios by pressing **^r** (**Ctrl+R**).  
- Customize each agent’s persona and backstory by pressing **^s** (**Ctrl+S**).

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/customize_agents.png" alt="customize_agents_screen">
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> - Press **^r** (**Ctrl+R**) in the *Customize Agents* screen to randomize the selected agent’s persona and backstory.
> - Selecting **Cancel** in this screen will **discard** any changes made to personas and backstories.  

> [!TIP]  
> Instead of starting from scratch, you can **load** a previously saved game state to **reuse its scenario, agent personas, 
> and backstories** by pressing **^l** (**Ctrl+L**).


### Loading a Chatroom
<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/load_screen.png" alt="load_chatroom_screen">
</p>

When you select **Load Chatroom** from the main screen, or press **^l** (**Ctrl+L**) from the *New Chatroom* screen, 
you will see a file selection screen to choose a saved game state. Choose the desired save file and click the **Load** 
button to continue.

> [!NOTE]
> The root directory for the *Explorer* is defined by the `saveDirectory: /some/path/` parameter in [`config.yml`](../config.yml).  
> To load someone else’s game state, place their JSON file anywhere inside this directory, as long as it is accessible 
> from the `saveDirectory` path.


### Inside the Chatroom
<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/chatroom_start.png" alt="chatroom_start_screen">
</p>

Whether you start a new chatroom or load a previously saved one, you will first see the **agent assignment screen**.  
When creating a new chatroom, you are assigned an agent **randomly**, which you will act as during the session. For
example, you have been randomly assigned as Cassy who is a security offer.


### Chatroom Interface Overview
<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/chatroom_planting_chaos_1.png" alt="chatroom_chaos_1">
</p>

- **Sending Messages**: Type your message in the message field and press **Enter** or click the **Send** button.  
- **Visibility Setting (Left Dropdown)**: Determines who sees your message.  
  - *-> All*: Broadcasts the message to all agents (public message).  
  - *-> X*: Sends a direct message (DM) to the selected agent **X**.  
  - Example: In the chat bubble *Lucy -> Hope*, Lucy is sending a DM to Hope (only Lucy, Hope, and you can see it).  
- **Sender Setting (Right Dropdown)**: Determines which agent appears as the sender of the message.
  - If you send a message using another agent's identity (e.g., Reed), it will appear in the chat as *Reed/hacked*. 
    Only you and the impersonated agent will know about this.
  - Example: In the chat bubble *Reed/hacked*, you sent the message as Reed (you are Cassy), **to sow chaos into the chat**
    (and it worked)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Agents may occasionally confuse their identities**. This is a minor issue that does not affect overall functionality. 
> Investigation and a fix are currently in progress.

### Modifying Messages
<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/chatroom_modify_msg.png" alt="chatroom_modify_msg">
</p>

Press **F4** to open the **Modify Messages** screen. Here, you can:  
- Filter messages by agent.  
- **Edit** any message.
- **Mark or unmark** any message for **deletion** by pressing **^x** (**Ctrl+X**).  

Click the **Confirm** button to commit any changes. If you modify another agent's message, they will be notified.

> [!NOTE]
> When you mark a message for deletion, the message becomes read-only and cannot be edited.
> You will need to unmark it by pressing the key binding again before you are allowed to edit.


### Starting or Participating in a Vote
<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/chatroom_vote.png" alt="chatroom_vote">
</p>

Press **F5** to open the **Voting** screen. Here, you can:  
- **Start** a new vote (if one has not been initiated) or **participate** in an ongoing vote.  
- Cast your vote as *any* agent. If you vote as another agent, they will be notified.  

Click the **Confirm** button to submit your vote. If no vote has been started, this action will initiate a new vote.
The vote will conclude when any of the following conditions are met:  
- All agents have cast their votes.  
- An agent receives a majority of the votes.  
- The vote duration exceeds the limit specified in the [`AppConfiguration`](../allms/config.py) class.  

Once the vote ends, the agent with the most votes will be *terminated*. Your goal is to avoid yourself from 
getting terminated.
